# things to ponder about
should status colors really be shown in backlog?
should buffer days really be counted down outside of daily tasks
should status colors be removed when a task is done for the day

# export tasks
develop a possibility to export and import tasks to external files for backups
also develop a possibility to sync with a folder on the filesystem
Filenames for that can be built like Discord snowflakes
Data can be exported to JSON

# Starting date
Enter a date on wich a task will be added to the dailies
should be easy when daily dates allow future timestamps

# mottos
- should last about a month
- defines a specific task set the user is busy with
- other tasks go in the archive (perhaps keeping their motto)
- mottos can be created, named (perhaps: given an icon)
- tasks can be assigned to a motto
- user should be encouraged to dedicate months to specific mottos
- user should be informed how mottos work, if they choose to use them

# daily workload / total workload
Differenciate between how much work a task is estimated to need and how much the user wants to work on a task on the given day.
